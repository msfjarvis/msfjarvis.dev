- I put out a new post this week [on my changing my stance on LLMs as coding assistants](/posts/coming-around-on-the-utility-of-llms/). I talked myself out of it a few times because the discourse around generative AI is so polarized but I ended up deciding that I shouldn't have to censor myself for fear of some angry mentions on Mastodon.

- The Steam Winter Sale is ending early next week, so I finally pulled the trigger and bought the stuff in my cart, likely to sit in my backlog forever. I ended up cutting out ARC Raiders because the extraction shooter genre isn't very appealing to me. The games I did buy are listed below:
  1. Balatro
  2. PEAK
  3. Slay The Spire
  4. The Witcher trilogy
  5. No Mans Sky

- Of the games I bought, Balatro ended up being the obvious first pick and has replaced Marvel Snap as my casual 15 minute game. I'm pretty sad that the mobile versions don't sync with my Steam copy of the game so I don't play it on mobile anymore.

- My sister called me out of the blue asking why her laptop is not as easily repairable anymore, and we had quite a nice conversation about [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) and [planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence). Pretty proud of her for being so cognizant about the state of consumerism in everyday life.
  - We ended up having another conversation later in the week around copyright law, because she wanted to find a book on [Anna's Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive) and was distraught to discover that the only domain she was aware of had been blocked. Having to explain why domains people paid for can just be taken away was, to say the least, _interesting_.

- My cheap and reliable fitness tracker, the [Amazfit GTS 2e](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B094NDV47Z), _almost_ succumbed to its 2 years of abuse. Thankfully I was able to seal it back shut with some superglue, but the vibration motor no longer works which means I don't get reminded to get off my ass every hour and the alarm functionality is useless. Maybe this is the universe's way of reinforcing my financially irresponsible desire of buying a Pixel Watch and adding [WearOS](https://wearos.google.com/) to my skill set.

{{<figure src="my-broken-watch.webp" alt="A picture of the aforementioned watch on my arm, with its display precariously detached from the rest of the body and only attached on the left side. The watch is kind of scuffed and filthy." height="480px" loading="lazy" >}}

- I [started reading](https://bookwyrm.social/user/msfjarvis/generatednote/9326045) the next part of the [Silo series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(series)): [Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(series)#Shift). With the constant power cuts happening here in Indiranagar, this book on my Kobo has been the only thing I can do reliably without the threat of an arbitrary interruption.

- [Roomie](https://yashgarg.dev/) and I met up with [Fenil](https://github.com/feniljain) this week for some tea and snacks, was lovely catching up and yapping about stuff. Hopefully we can make it a regular thing!

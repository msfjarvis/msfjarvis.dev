I got inspired by [Abhinav](https://abhinavsarkar.net/notes/tags/weeknotes/) and [Ankur](https://ankursethi.com/) last week to start writing weeknotes, so I spent that weekend setting up my existing journaling system to expose weeknote-relevant entries in a nice single page view (you can read about that [here](https://msfjarvis.dev/notes/collating-entries-in-my-obsidian-journal-for-week-notes/)). This is the first weeknote as a direct result of that, being written at [IndieWebClub #16](https://underline.center/t/indiewebclub-16-with-ankur-and-tanvi/622)!

- I finished my personal reading goal of 24 books this year, being tracked [here](https://bookwyrm.social/user/msfjarvis/goal/2025). Next year I wanna blend in a bit more non-fiction into this, and hopefully raise the count by a few more.
- Continuing on the book front, I finished the last two short stories from the Murderbot series: [Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory](https://torpublishinggroup.com/home-habitat-range-niche-territory/?isbn=9781250838865&format=ebook) and [Rapport: Friendship, Solidarity, Communion, Empathy](https://torpublishinggroup.com/rapport-friendship-solidarity-communion-empathy/?isbn=9781250425362&format=ebook), and started reading [Wool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(series)#Wool).
- There was an alumni dinner for [Obvious](https://www.obvious.in/) on Wednesday where we ended up with 20+ people at [Idylll](https://www.idylllindia.com/). Met a lot of people from before my time at Obvious, and caught up with the ones I did work with. Super fun experience, was very glad that I could make it.
- My Telegram account got banned for no particular reason, likely by mass reporting by someone I pissed off and forgot about? I've reconvened on Discord for now but it's clearly a problem that my primary communication platform can just evaporate overnight. I can set something up for myself but moving over friends is gonna be the real pain.
- I watched [Dhurandhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhurandhar) on Thursday with a couple of friends and it was great! Bit more gory than I expected from Bollywood and the CGI was a little iffy but the story and acting more than make up for it.
- I tried getting back into [Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com/) but the combat is not really working for me, so I'll let the roguelike fever die down for a bit and pick up [Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(video_game)) or [Horizon Forbidden West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Forbidden_West) which I've been sitting on for a while.
- At work I've mostly been busy with the [Kotlin 2.3.0](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew23.html) upgrade which has a lot performance improvements and additions relevant to our needs. I was able to get everything to work, but unfortunately can't ship it without a compatible [SKIE](https://github.com/touchlab/SKIE/issues/173) release. Hopefully soon!
- I finally added search to this blog! It's something I had wanted for a long while and being at IndieWebClub finally motivated me to execute on it. I'm pretty happy with the result, but I intend to customize the UI and search result ranking a bit since I saw some instances of tag pages being prioritized over the actual blog post using the tag.

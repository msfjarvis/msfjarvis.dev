I made a couple of purchases yesterday, including a Bluetooth speaker and a USB Bluetooth dongle to pair it to my computer. Now here's a couple things that you need to know about said computer:

- This runs Linux
- It runs a customized build of the Zen kernel with a very slimmed down config
- The computer has never had Bluetooth connectivity before

Thanks to this combination of factors, things got weird.

Inspired by [Abhinav](https://abhinavsarkar.net/notes/tags/weeknotes/) and [Ankur](https://ankursethi.com/) to start writing weeknotes, last weekend I set up my existing journaling system to also expose weeknote-relevant entries (you can read about that [here](https://msfjarvis.dev/notes/collating-entries-in-my-obsidian-journal-for-week-notes/)). This is the first weeknote as a direct result of that, being written at [IndieWebClub #16](https://underline.center/t/indiewebclub-16-with-ankur-and-tanvi/622)!

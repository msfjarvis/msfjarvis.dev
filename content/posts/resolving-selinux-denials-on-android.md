This blog post is mostly comprised of what used to be a [gist](https://gist.github.com) of mine. I decided it needs some additional reading on what exactly we're dealing with so a preface outlining what SELinux is and how to understand the rules we're writing has been added. The gist itself is from a time when I was far less knowledgeable and hence adjustments have been made accordingly, often with extra information.

### What is SELinux?

SELinux is an acronym for **Security-enhanced Linux**. It is a security feature built into the [Linux kernel](http://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/security/selinux) that enforces access control for programs via a predefined security policy put in place by the system adminstrators.


Traditionally, access control on Linux has been done under the **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** methodology. Under DAC, each process runs under a user and group. A process can access all files owned by it's user and/or group.

[nixCraft](https://cyberciti.biz) has an example centering around httpd to highlight the differences between DAC and MAC.

**SELinux** is an implementation of a MAC security mechanism. MAC stands for **Mandatory Access Control**, a paradigm that allows restricting multiple aspects of a process like

- Pipes
- Files
- Network ports
- Sockets
- Directories
- Other processes

SELinux builds upon DAC-based restrictions and adds additional layers of restrictions above UID and GID to ensure a compromised user can still be restricted from doing things it normally wouldn't need to do.


### How to detect and resolve SELinux denials on Android

Here's a sample denial that we'll attempt to resolve.

```java
avc: denied { read write } for pid=29059 comm="i.tetherservice" name="ipa" dev="tmpfs" ino=11991
scontext=u:r:system_app:s0 tcontext=u:object_r:ipa_dev:s0 tclass=chr_file permissive=0
```

The policy rule to resolve it:

```java
allow system_app ipa_dev:chr_file {read write};
```

How did I write it?

First, you need to identify the process/device which attempted the action which raised the denial.

The value in `scontext` is the offender. In our case, it is **system_app**.

<br />
Next, find the domains where access was attempted. This is found by taking the value of tcontext, splitting it on the **:** delimiter and taking index 2, or the second value from right. Club it with
the value of tclass and you get the domain, which is **ipa_dev:chr_file** in our example.

<br />
Finally, find the action being performed. This is fairly simple. If you see `avc: denied { read write }`, then **{read write}** is the action here.

<br />
Put this all together and you get the final sepolicy rule.


### Labelling in SELinux

To define new types for adding sepolicy exclusions, we use labelling.

For this example, let's assume we want to label the KCal sysfs nodes under the `sysfs_kcal` type.

KCal sysfs nodes are inside the `/sys/devices/platform/kcal_ctrl.0/` directory. To put them all under a single label, we use a simple regex. The type name should be added to `file_contexts` in your device tree's sepolicy folder. If it doesn't exist, create it with the following contents (append if the file exists).

<br />
`/sys/devices/platform/kcal_ctrl.0(/.*)?              u:object_r:sysfs_kcal:s0`

<br />
This line in `file_contexts` will label all files in the `/sys/devices/platform/kcal_ctrl.0/` directory as `sysfs_kcal`.

Next we open up the sepolicy file for the domain we want to grant access to the label. For this example, the domain is **system_app**, so we open **system_app.te**. As before, just create it if it doesn't exist.

`type sysfs_kcal, fs_type, sysfs_type;`

There, we can now add exclusions for `sysfs_kcal` treating it as a sysfs node as well as a filesystem item, like a folder or a file.

To be able to read or write to the sysfs node, we need to be able to find it first.
Then we need to grant `system_app` the ability to read and write from and to it.

`allow system_app sysfs_kcal:dir search;`
`allow system_app sysfs_kcal:file rw_file_perms;`


And that's it! Now all system apps can read from and write to all nodes in the `/sys/devices/platform/kcal_ctrl.0/`
directory.

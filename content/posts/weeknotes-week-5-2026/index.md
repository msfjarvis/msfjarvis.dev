This week was mostly spent back in my ancestral village with effectively zero internet, so this weeknote is being typed up on my phone at 8:40 PM because I completely forgot about it.

The most interesting part of my week was me getting involved in some Discourse™ over a Cloudflare blog post that made dubious claims about a vibe coded Matrix implementation that was written to run on Workers. Needless to say I will not be exercising my "Disclaimer: I'm a CF employee but do not speak for the company" rights in the future.

On a positive note despite the biting cold and fog I've been able to get a solid 3-4 hours in the sun every day which were often translated into _heavenly_ naps. To put it in perspective how rare it is for me to sleep out of turn, I've owned my Amazfit tracker for 2 years and this week is when I first discovered it tracks naps. During all the sun bathing I also managed to get through the first half of [The Book of Ile-Rien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ile-Rien#The_Element_of_Fire).

And that's kinda it! Having little to no access to the Internet has been kind of driving me crazy but I preloaded the Kobo with enough material to have no excuse to not just be reading, so that's what I've been using my time for. The entirety of next week is going to be wrapped up in the festivities for the wedding I'm here for so I expect to have another light weeknote which will thankfully be written from Bengaluru :)

First of all, as the [official Gradle documentation] states, "init scripts" are not the same thing as the `gradle init` command that initializes a new Gradle build in the current directory.


# What are init scripts?

They are regular build scripts seen elsewhere in Gradle, but are executed *before* the build starts. They can be used to register external listeners, add plugins to the build or specify machine-specific properties such as the location of a particular SDK required to build the project.

However, you can also use them to apply common configurations to *every* Gradle project on your machine, *automatically*.

# (Ab)using init scripts for fun and profit

Linux users might be familiar with the `/etc/init.d/` directory, that lets you run arbitrary scripts during the boot process. Gradle comes with a similar setup for init scripts at `$GRADLE_USER_HOME/init.d` (`GRADLE_USER_HOME` is by default the `$HOME/.gradle` directory).

So, what can you add here? Almost anything!

On my machines, I currently have two init scripts. One that automatically adds Ben Manes' [gradle-versions-plugin] (also where I first discovered init scripts!), and another that does the same for Mi≈Çosz Lewandowski's [can-i-drop-jetifier]. The scripts look something like this

```groovy
// $HOME/init.d/can-i-drop-jetifier.gradle

initscript {
  repositories {
    gradlePluginPortal()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "com.github.plnice:canidropjetifier:0.5"
  }
}

allprojects {
  apply plugin: com.github.plnice.canidropjetifier.CanIDropJetifierPlugin
}
```

You'll notice that the `apply plugin:` syntax is using the actual class name rather than just the plugin name, which I believe is the only way to actually apply plugins from an init script.

# Caveats

Like everything in software, there are some problems you might run into, specifically with the `init.d`-based setup.

If a project already has a plugin applied that you have configured in your `$GRADLE_USER_HOME/init.d` directory, it will fail the build with a classpath clash. The solution is to either rename the file in `init.d` to prevent it from being picked up by Gradle (`mv can-i-drop-jetifier.gradle can-i-drop-jetifier.gradle.disabled`), or to temporarily remove it from the project in question.

If you have an actual solution for this, please let me know on [Twitter] or post a comment below :)

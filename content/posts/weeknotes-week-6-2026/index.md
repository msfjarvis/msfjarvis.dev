After 3 weeks of being away, I am finally back in Bengaluru this weekend. I was also off work for the past ~10 days, so I am looking forward to spending half of my Monday sorting through emails and unread Google Chat messages. I may never hit Inbox Zero ever again...

To start off the week, I finally got my first [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/)  win off an extremely lucky draw of jokers – one which gave "mult" equal to the sell value of all jokers and another that gained sell value each turn. I also hit an extremely lucky spectral card that replaced a whole hand with jesters. The seed for that run was `A7IBENU9`, in case anyone wants to show me up :P

I also introduced Balatro to my sister who got the hang of the Poker aspect of it, but doesn't quite get the Roguelike part yet.

Outside Balatro and the occasional ceremony for the wedding I was attending, I occupied my time in trying to finish reading the minor behemoth that was [Book of Ile-Rien](https://bookwyrm.social/book/1584147/s/book-of-ile-rien). When I finally got done with it, I realized I had basically every Martha Wells book on the Kobo _except_ the sequels to the Ile-Rien series which I wanted to read next :'D

The eBook edition was not available on the Kobo India store so I had to get it from Barnes & Noble, then figure out how to transfer it to the Kobo which also became a quick note [on the blog](https://msfjarvis.dev/notes/til-easily-sending-ebooks-to-a-kobo/).

The flight back to Bengaluru was a Boeing which didn't quite inspire confidence, and the rather rough turbulence in the last 15 minutes of the journey had me genuinely fearing for my life but I made it down in one piece. I had to wait a while for the 3:30 PM bus back to Indiranagar but it was made pleasant by the AC lounge in the basement bus pickup area of the Kempegowda Airport.

Earlier in the week I had discovered (via [IndieWebify](https://indiewebify.me/)) about the existence of the [h-entry](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry) standard, and the site implements it now.

I was planning to be at [IndieWebClub #19](https://underline.center/t/indiewebclub-19/708/1) today, having been away for the last 2 iterations of it but I woke up with the sniffles and didn't have the energy for it. Hopefully next time 🤞

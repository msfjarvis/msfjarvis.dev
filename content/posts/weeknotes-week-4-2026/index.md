I'm still back at home so there's not been a whole lot happening with my life other than being unable to deal with the cold.

- I started reading [The Book of Ile-Rien](https://bookwyrm.social/book/1584147/s/book-of-ile-rien), without realizing that the copy I bought is actually a combined version of [The Element of Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ile-Rien#The_Element_of_Fire) and [Death of the Necromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ile-Rien#Death_of_the_Necromancer) so I have a 900+ page behemoth on my hand that is a departure from the  science fiction fare I usually consume. In six chapters I'm up to 17 unique words describing medieval things that I had to look up so overall this has been quite the experience.

- The Pixel Watch I ordered last week came in on Tuesday and by Thursday its display had already developed horrid discoloration that forced me to put it in for an [RMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_merchandise_authorization) and get a replacement. It's particularly bad timing since I will be traveling to my hometown soon for a marriage and then head back to Bengaluru, so I tried to have it be picked up from here and get it delivered in Bengaluru. Unfortunately the support executive I talked to got the wires crossed on that and scheduled the pickup from Bengaluru 🥲. Still trying to get that sorted.

- We had a fair amount of thunder and rains on Friday which immediately knocked out both me and the power grid. The power came back 7-8 hours later but I continue to have the worst cold.

Being away from work for a couple of weeks now hasn't been as isolating as I would've expected which says good things about the team, but it has still been quite the drudgery being stuck inside what with the cold and the rain. I already miss the fabled Bengaluru weather...

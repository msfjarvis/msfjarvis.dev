This week has been quite difficult on the mental, with the death of my maternal grandmother and my childhood best friend's father in quick succession. I'll be going home for their last rites next week, and probably miss the weeknote posting schedule. Despite the horrible start, other things did happen during the rest of the days as listed out below.

- I had to shave my beard because of some skin irritation that I am medicating for, which apparently was enough to confuse my landlord into wondering who I was.
- As I am in a quite Mediterranean time of my life, another batch of hummus was created, this time with a lot of more spices and it came out quite delicious indeed.
- My phone has had the "pink line of dead pixels" syndrome for a while but it finally became enough of a problem for me to get it repaired, and in the process Android's [Repair Mode](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/14266732?hl=en) bugged out and forced me to wipe my device to get it out of repair mode. Quite the annoyance to put onto a person already in the dumps, made worse by a Firefox bug that [caused passkeys to not work](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2009251).
- The aforementioned data wipe also exposed a bug in [Claw](https://github.com/msfjarvis/compose-lobsters/) which prevented auto backup from working, so at  least [something good](https://github.com/msfjarvis/compose-lobsters/commit/e07bd441a8801bbb5b633636076dc36a154fe30d) came out of me losing 3 months of saved posts since I had last backed things up manually.
- [Willi Geiger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willigeiger), the head of the Cloudflare Media team was visiting the Bengaluru office this week. He took a session explaining the Media business as well as 1:1 meetings with every one of us who works in the Media team. Was nice having him around, shadowing how we do things in the Bengaluru office.
- Watched [Avatar Fire and Ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar%3A_Fire_and_Ash) with a couple of friends, as usual it's a great spectacle with a flimsy story. Hollywood, keep giving this guy money to justify the existence of IMAX.
- Last week I had ordered some accessories for the [IKEA Pegboard](https://www.ikea.com/in/en/cat/skadis-series-37813/) which arrived on Saturday, and I was finally able to fill out the thing and put up some of the stuff that was cluttering my desk.
- [Yash](https://yashgarg.dev) and I have been experimenting on the cooking front to start making more things than our usual 4 dishes and made some [baingan bharta](https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/baingan-bharta-recipe-punjabi-baingan-bharta-recipe/) on Saturday. Definitely burnt some of my fingertips off while roasting and peeling the eggplants but completely worth it.

As I mentioned [last week](/posts/weeknotes-week-2-2026/), I've been traveling most of this week to attend the last rites of some immediate family that passed away at the start of this year. This has meant limited access to my computer and taking the week off work which might've been a blessing in some part.

- When I was leaving Bangalore, I tried taking a [KIA BengaWalk](https://kia.bengawalk.com/) electric bus to the airport but it never showed up so I ended up in an expensive taxi instead. My experience with the bus network was pretty good when I used it last time to return from the airport so this was quite disappointing.
- [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) updated this week to use rounded elements everywhere which I have mixed feelings about. It hasn't felt too disruptive this week but I also didn't use it all that much due to being mostly offline, so we'll see in the next couple of weeks what side of the fence I end up on.
- Finished reading [Shift](https://bookwyrm.social/book/225118/s/shift) on the flight to Varanasi.
- Immediately picked up [Dust](https://bookwyrm.social/book/65228/s/dust) once I reached the village.
- The generally poor mobile network at the village exposed a failure condition for the home screen widget in my app [Claw](https://github.com/msfjarvis/compose-lobsters/), so I took a crack at having [Copilot](https://github.com/copilot) implement a caching feature to make the updates tolerant of transiently bad network. It took some prodding to make it all work, but in the end I was mostly satisfied with its ability to copy existing code [[PR]](https://github.com/msfjarvis/compose-lobsters/pull/1041).
- The day before we were supposed to head back home, I got roped into assembling wedding invites with my Dad which ended up taking most of our time but it was nice to catch up with Dad for an extended period that I usually don't get the opportunity for.
- We ended up splitting our drive back home with a pit stop in Allahabad at a family friend, and I ashamedly used that time to catch up with work. I had completely forgotten about the Q1 kickoff meetings so there's a couple of hours of recordings to watch when I'm back next week.
- We left bright and early for the drive back which was rather rough with the heavy fog. I used the time in the car to finish off reading [Dust](https://bookwyrm.social/book/65228/s/dust), which might've been the fastest I've gotten through 300+ pages. The Silo series is written in quite a cliffhanger-heavy style where every chapter keeps you hooked, so I found it hard to put down. No complaints though, I loved all 3 books.
- My Amazfit fitness tracker fell apart [again](/posts/weeknotes-week-1-2026/) so I finally ordered the Pixel Watch 4 I had been eyeing, with a [sturdy case](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0FWT8ND63) to protect it from my neglect.

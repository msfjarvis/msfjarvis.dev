This was my first week back in the office after an absence of 3 weeks which was a nice return to my usual routine. Catching up with 10 days of emails and messages wasn't as herculean of a task as I had expected :D

I was finally able to put in a replacement request for the defective Pixel Watch 4 I had purchased [a couple of weeks ago](/posts/weeknotes-week-4-2026/) now that I was in Bengaluru and delivery was a more straightforward affair. Finding the chat option for this was an absolute nightmare trying to navigate Google's endless mazes but once I was in there it was a pretty easy process. Blue Dart's speed was quite the savior, and I got the replacement device back in just 3 days.

Now that I have a more capable fitness tracker I've been trying to be more mindful about staying active, which has been going less than stellar because I had been away from the gym for nearly a month so building back my endurance and stamina is gonna take a few more days. Definitely going to try and push for 10K steps a day again.

On Wednesday I fell on my way back from the gym by getting my foot stuck in an uneven footpath, which left me with some light but painful bruises. Thankfully they seem to have buffed out over the week, and the only permanent damage is going to be to my phone case :')

On Friday, my roommate Yash and I decided to try out making burritos which were quite scuffed but ultimately rather delicious. The 8 inch burrito wraps that we got ended up being rather small, and the absence of any burrito wrapping skill between the two of us did not help the situation. Would like to try it again sometime if we can find bigger wraps, or maybe make our own.

Valentine's day was spent enjoying my own company and working on some homelab stuff I had been putting off. My Git server is constantly being spammed by Chinese and Vietnamese spammers, which I [tried to mitigate unsuccessfully](https://androiddev.social/@msfjarvis/116069080640569258). Will take another stab at it soon.

I also put out a [new release of Claw](https://github.com/msfjarvis/compose-lobsters/releases/tag/v1.60.0) since it had been a month since the previous one, and it seems to have not exploded right away so that's a relief.

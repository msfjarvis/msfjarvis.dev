- With some help from my roommate, I've started doing some proper weight training at the gym to speed up my weight loss journey and help build up some muscle definition. Way too early for any results, but the burn of a good workout feels nice until the soreness sets in :P
- The Periodic Notes plug in I use for Obsidian has a bug with how it handles week alignments ([here](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes/issues/238)) which prevented the "Open weekly note" command from working. Thankfully I realized that Obsidian plugins are just regular files in my vault so I was able to go in and fix the bug and have it fully work again!
- My Telegram account was suspended last week under dubious circumstances, and I was finally able to get it back on Thursday by appealing the suspension again. Apparently this time round my appeal got accepted in 1 minute flat, but I didn't notice until way later in the day because I had no expectations from them.
- I've been having a bit of a monster week working on [Claw](https://github.com/msfjarvis/compose-lobsters/), my Android client for [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs). I fixed every single crash logged on Sentry, did a long-pending migration to drop a deprecated dependency injection library, and added a chunky suite of end-to-end tests using [Maestro](https://maestro.dev) to paper over the lack of unit testing. Soon™
- Making hummus at home has been a longstanding goal of mine which I finally acted on this week, and it came out quite nice! Originally I planned to make my own [Tahini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahini) as well but I realized quite quickly that I don't have the patience to roast sesame seeds for an hour :)

I'm writing this at 9 PM on a Sunday which for a weeknote feels like turning in an assignment at 11:59 PM on the due date, going forward I'll try to block a chunk of time earlier in the day to work on this. The [Obsidian setup I created](https://msfjarvis.dev/notes/collating-entries-in-my-obsidian-journal-for-week-notes/) to help with these weeknotes is still coming in quite handy, makes me quite happy that I chose to [migrate out of Logseq](https://msfjarvis.dev/posts/migrating-from-logseq-to-obsidian/) earlier this year.

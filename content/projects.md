Over the years I have worked on and contributed to various projects in the Android community. I am currently a project maintainer for [substratum](https://github.com/substratum) and [Android Password Store](https://github.com/zeapo/Android-Password-Store). My personal projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis),
notable projects include:

- [Viscerion](https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis/viscerion): Android client for the WireGuard™️  VPN protocol. Built with Android Jetpack and Kotlin.
- [floating-action-button](https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis/floating-action-button): Yet another Android library, this time for drawing Material Design promoted
  actions.
- [Caesium Kernel for the OnePlus 3/3T](https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis/oneplus3): A custom kernel for the OnePlus 3/3T, designed to be lean, quick and efficient while
  staying up-to-date with kernel.org linux-stable releases.

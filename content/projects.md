Over the years I have worked on and contributed to various projects in the Android community. I am currently the project maintainer for [substratum](https://github.com/substratum). My personal projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis),
notable projects include:

- [wireguard-kt](https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis/wireguard-kt): A fork of the official [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com/) Android client with with a nicer UI and additional features. Rewritten to use kotlin for most of the project.
- [floating-action-button](https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis/floating-action-button): Yet another Android library, this time for drawing Material Design promoted
  actions.
- [Caesium Kernel for the OnePlus 3/3T](https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis/oneplus3): A custom kernel for the OnePlus 3/3T, designed to be lean, quick and efficient while
  staying up-to-date with kernel.org linux-stable releases.

Over the years I have worked on and contributed to various projects in the Android community. I am currently an application
developer at [substratum](https://github.com/substratum). My personal projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis),
notable projects include:

- [AppRate](http://msfjarvis.website/AppRate/): This is an Android library that can be used to show a Play Store rating dialog in apps based on certain
  conditions. Details about all the available methods are on the documentation website.
- [floating-action-button](https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis/floating-action-button): Yet another Android library, this time for drawing Material Design promoted
  actions.
- [Caesium Kernel for the OnePlus 3/3T](https://kutt.it/caesiumop3): A custom kernel for the OnePlus 3/3T, designed to be lean, quick and efficient while
  staying up-to-date with kernel.org linux-stable releases.


I am also interning for [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com), a next generation kernel-space VPN with a focus on speed and privacy.

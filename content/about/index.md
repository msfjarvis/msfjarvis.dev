I'm an Android and Kotlin developer with 8 years of experience building apps that have scaled up to hundreds of thousands daily active users and design systems for some of the largest startups in India.

### Work

I currently work at [Cloudflare] as a Systems Engineer. I was previously at [Dyte], which was acquired by Cloudflare in early 2025.

You can find the latest version of [my resume here].

### Projects

Some things I built to scratch a personal itch, that people found generally useful.

- [Android Password Store]: A password manager for Android aiming to be fully compatible with the [pass] format. I no longer work on this, but there are active forks around for people who still use [pass].
- [Claw]: A read-only Android client for [lobste.rs], written entirely in [Jetpack Compose].
- [healthchecks-rs]: A Rust library for interacting with [healthchecks.io] and a couple CLI tools that utilise it.
- [linkleaner]: Telegram bot to automatically improve link previews.

### Contact

You can find me on [Mastodon], I used to have a Twitter but I've deactivated the account for well understood reasons. I'd be happy to write back if you'd like to send me an [email]!

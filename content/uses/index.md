## Editor + Terminal

I use Ghostty with `bash` and a lightly customized [starship](https://starship.rs) prompt. The editor I use depends on what code I am working with:

- Web, Python, Rust: [Zed](https://zed.dev)
- Android: Android Studio
- Kotlin: IntelliJ IDEA

My terminal-based text editor of choice is currently [micro](https://micro-editor.com/).

### Development environment

I use [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) with [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to maintain my development environment and dotfiles. My current Nix/NixOS configuration can be found in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/msfjarvis/dotfiles).

On my work MacBook I've resigned to using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) exclusively due to issues I faced in making Nix work with our internal VPN and endpoint protection software.

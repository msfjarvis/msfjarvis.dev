## Editor + Terminal

I use the `gnome-terminal` that ships with Linux Mint's Cinnamon Edition with `bash` and a custom prompt from [starship](https://starship.rs). The editor I use depends on what code I am working with:

* Web, Python: VS Code
* Rust: VS Code or CLion
* Android: Android Studio
* Kotlin (outside Android): IntelliJ IDEA

I also tend to use [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) for quick edits on the terminal. Fight me.

### CLI tooling

My love for Rust extends deep into the CLI, and a lot of GNU tools are replaced with their Rust reimplementations for better performance and useful features. Notably, the replacements are:

| GNU version | Rust version | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cat | bat | GitHub |
| cd | zoxide | GitHub |
| du | diskus | GitHub |
| find | fd | GitHub |
| grep | ripgrep | GitHub |

~~I have begun using~~ [~~Homebrew~~](https://brew.sh) ~~to maintain software on my machines so you can see most stuff I have on my PC in this~~ [~~Brewfile~~](https://github.com/msfjarvis/dotfiles/blob/master/homebrew/Brewfile)~~.~~ I now officially despise Homebrew, and use [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) instead. Yes, I'm fickle, how'd you guess?

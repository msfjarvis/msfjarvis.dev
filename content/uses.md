This website is built with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), deployed continuously by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and served by [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) behind [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). I use a mix of local editing and the [Forestry](https://forestry.io) CMS for managing the content on the site.

## Editor + Terminal

I use the `gnome-terminal` that ships with Linux Mint's Cinnamon Edition with `bash` and a custom prompt from [starship](https://starship.rs). The editor I use depends on what code I am working with:

- Web, Python: VS Code
- Rust: VS Code or CLion
- Android: Android Studio
- Kotlin (outside Android): IntelliJ IDEA

I also tend to use [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) for quick edits on the terminal.

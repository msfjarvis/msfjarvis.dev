I am 20 year old Android developer with more than 4 years of experience building apps and library of various sizes. I love working with [Kotlin](https://github.com/msfjarvis?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=kotlin) and am learning [Rust](https://github.com/msfjarvis?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=rust). Some of my work in open-source is documented on the [projects page](/projects), and the rest of them can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/msfjarvis) profile. I am available for hire, and the latest copy of my resume can be found [here](/resume.pdf).

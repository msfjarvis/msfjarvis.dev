I'm an Android and Kotlin developer with over 4 years of experience building apps and SDKs of varying sizes.

I'm based out of Ghaziabad, India.

### Work

Presently, I am a Product Engineer at [Obvious] where I work with [Swiggy] to build client libraries for their new design system. Before that I worked at [Navana Tech] and [PRJKT Development LLC].

For more details you can find the latest version of [my resume here].

### Interests

Things I spend my time reading over, tinkering with and learning about.

- Open-Source Technologies
- Rust
- Kotlin Multiplatform

### Projects

A few ideas that I've gone ahead and built in my spare time. You can support them if you like by [donating here].

- [Android Password Store]: A password manager for Android aiming to be fully compatible with the [pass] format.
- [Claw]: A Kotlin multiplatform app for read-only access to [lobste.rs].
- [healthchecks-rs]: A Rust library for interacting with [healthchecks.io] and a couple CLI tools that utilise it.

### Contact

I'd be happy to write back if you'd like to send me an [email]. Otherwise you can follow me on [Twitter] or [Github].

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

Updated January 18th, 2026 from [IndieWebClub Bangalore](https://blr.indiewebclub.org/).

## Work

[RealtimeKit](https://realtime.cloudflare.com/), mostly catching up with syncing documentation to the Cloudflare Developers site and giving it a modernization pass in the process.

## Personal

Two deaths in my immediate family in the span of a week forced me to make an emergency trip to my maternal village and my home so I'm mostly helping with things for the last rites wherever I can.

## Reading

[Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(series)#Shift), book 2 of the Silo series. Super entertaining read so far.

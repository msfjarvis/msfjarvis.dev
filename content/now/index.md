This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about).

Updated January 3rd, 2026 from [IndieWebClub Bangalore](https://blr.indiewebclub.org/).

## Work

[RealtimeKit](https://realtime.cloudflare.com/), mostly documentation to tide us over while we're in a limited deployment window for the end of year holidays.

## Personal

I'm using my 2 week spurt of motivation to push forward a lot of crash fixes and UI tweaks to [Claw](https://github.com/msfjarvis/compose-lobsters/), my Android app for [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs).

## Reading

[Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(series)#Shift), book 2 of the Silo series. Super entertaining read so far.

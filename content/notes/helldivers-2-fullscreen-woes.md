Helldivers 2 on Linux hates full screen mode and will fail to start the next time after you switch display to full screen. This is why it breaks randomly for me on Linux and seemingly gets fixed after an update since Arrowhead randomly reverts back to windowed when the game is updated. Work around is to always use Borderless instead.

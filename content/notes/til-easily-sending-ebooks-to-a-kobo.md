Discovered [send.djazz.se](https://send.djazz.se) via a Reddit comment that greatly simplifies sending eBooks to a Kobo in the absence of a computer to run Calibre on.

Simply go to the website on the Kobo, memorize the 4 digit code it generates then go to the same website on your other device, enter the code and upload your file. Within a few seconds it should show up on the Kobo as a downloadable link, and it has the additional options to convert your eBook into a native format for the target device. Super convenient!

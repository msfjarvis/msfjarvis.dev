New section woo! This is mostly going to be used for relatively smaller things that I don't find worthy of a blogpost but are a bit awkward to fit into a [toot](https://androiddev.social/@msfjarvis).

Over time I plan to backfill this with the contents of my Obsidian Vault's "TIL" folder and then just use this public listing for the purpose, since it's equally accessible to me via the excellent [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms/).

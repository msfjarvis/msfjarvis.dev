# Contributing

First off, thank you for your time and effort! This project is not very large
and easy to jump into.

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd hugo-theme-codex

yarn install
```

## Scripts

```bash
yarn develop
```

Triggers a one-time build of the static directory.

```bash
yarn format
```

Runs prettier on the entire project directory.

## Assets

The `assets/` directory is where you can write JS and SCSS, which get processed
into CSS files before being placed in the `static/` directory.

# msfjarvis.dev [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/05925653-db74-4330-be83-60e83384f868/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/msfjarvis-dev/deploys)

Source code for my website at [msfjarvis.dev](https://msfjarvis.dev). It's built with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), deployed continuously by [Netlify](https://netlify.com). I use a mix of local editing and the [Forestry](https://forestry.io) CMS for managing the content on the site.

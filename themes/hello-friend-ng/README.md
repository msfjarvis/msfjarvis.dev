# Hello Friend NG

![Hello Friend NG](https://dsh.re/d27822)



## General informations

This theme was highly inspired by the [hello-friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) and [hermit](https://github.com/Track3/hermit).


## Features

- Theming: **dark/light mode**, depending on your preferences (dark is default, but you can change it)
- Great reading experience thanks to [**Inter UI font**](https://rsms.me/inter/), made by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/about/)
- Nice code highlighting thanks to [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- An easy way to modify the theme with Hugo tooling
- Fully responsive
- Support for social

#### Built-in shortcodes

- **`image`** (prop required: **`src`**; props optional: **`alt`**, **`position`** (**left** is default | center | right), **`style`**)
  - eg: `{{< image src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}`
- **`figure`** (same as `image`, plus few optional props: **`caption`**, **`captionPosition`** (left | **center** is default | right), **`captionStyle`**
  - eg: `{{< figure src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Hello Friend!" captionPosition="right" captionStyle="color: red;" >}}`

#### Code highlighting

By default the theme is using PrismJS to color your code syntax. All you need to do is to wrap you code like this:

<pre>
```html
  // your code here
```
</pre>

**Supported languages**: https://prismjs.com/#languages-list

## How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to [https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git) and pasting it to `themes/hello-friend-ng` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng
```

If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you can get new updates when they are available. To do so, include it as a git submodule:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng
```
